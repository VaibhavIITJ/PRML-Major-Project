Accidents on road are a major cause of death and injury worldwide. Accidents can have a significant impact on individuals, families, and society as a whole. So, predicting accident severity and location can help authorities in implementing better safety measures and infrastructure to reduce accidents and their severity. It can help emergency services respond quickly and efficiently, potentially reducing the severity of injuries and loss of life. For this, machine learning can be a great help.

In this project, different machine learning models are used to predict accident severity and location from a dataset that covers 49 states of USA.

Different ML concepts that are used in this project are:
<br>• &emsp; Decision Tree Classifier
<br>• &emsp; Random Forest Classifier
<br>• &emsp; Boosting - Ada Boost and XG Boost
<br>• &emsp; Linear Regression
<br>• &emsp; SVM (Support Vector Machine)
<br>• &emsp; KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour)
